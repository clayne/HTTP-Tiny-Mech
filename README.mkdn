# NAME

HTTP::Tiny::Mech - Wrap a WWW::Mechanize instance in an HTTP::Tiny compatible interface.

# VERSION

version 0.2.0

# SYNOPSIS

    # Get something that expects an HTTP::Tiny instance
    # to work with HTTP::Mechanize under the hood.
    #
    my $thing => ThingThatExpectsHTTPTiny->new(
      ua => HTTP::Tiny::Mech->new()
    );

    # Get something that expects HTTP::Tiny
    # to work via WWW::Mechanize::Cached
    #
    my $thing => ThingThatExpectsHTTPTiny->new(
      ua => HTTP::Tiny::Mech->new(
        mechua => WWW::Mechanize::Cached->new( )
      );
    );

# DESCRIPTION

This code is somewhat poorly documented, and highly experimental.

Its the result of a quick bit of hacking to get [MetaCPAN::API](https://metacpan.org/pod/MetaCPAN::API) working faster
via the [WWW::Mechanize::Cached](https://metacpan.org/pod/WWW::Mechanize::Cached) module ( and gaining cache persistence via
[CHI](https://metacpan.org/pod/CHI) )

It works so far for this purpose.

At present, only ["get"](#get) and ["request"](#request) are implemented, and all other calls
fall through to a native [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny).

# WRAPPED METHODS

## get

Interface should be the same as it is with ["get" in HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny#get).

## request

Interface should be the same as it is with ["request" in HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny#request)
