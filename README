HTTP::Tiny::Mech

This code is somewhat poorly documented, and highly experimental.

Its the result of a quick bit of hacking to get "MetaCPAN::API" working
faster via the "WWW::Mechanize::Cached" module ( and gaining cache
persistence via "CHI" )

It works so far for this purpose.

At present, only "get" and "request" are implemented, and all other
calls fall through to a native "HTTP::Tiny".
